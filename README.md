# Unite: Polaris Hack Session

Join us at our 420 Wellington office for a [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) open source hack session. Led by folks on our team, you'll get a chance to connect with others who are looking for ways to build using Polaris.
 
Add a [new Github issue](https://github.com/Shopify/unite_hack_session/issues/new) to the repo describing what youâ€™d like to work on, and let's get hacking. Please come with your personal laptop and ensure you've downloaded the [Polaris UI Kit](https://polaris.shopify.com/resources/polaris-ui-kit#navigation). An understanding of [Polaris React](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) is also helpful.
