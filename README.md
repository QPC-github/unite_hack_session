# Unite: Polaris Hack Session

Join us at our 420 Wellington office for a [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) open source hack session. Led by folks on our team, you'll get a chance to connect with others who are looking for ways to build using Polaris.
 
Add a [new Github issue](https://github.com/Shopify/unite_hack_session/issues/new) to the repo describing what youâ€™d like to work on, and let's get hacking. Please come with your personal laptop and ensure you've downloaded the [Polaris UI Kit](https://polaris.shopify.com/resources/polaris-ui-kit#navigation). An understanding of [Polaris React](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) is also helpful.

Here are a few starting off points:

1. Build out an app layout using [Polaris' Layout info in Patterns and Guides](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns-and-guides/layout#navigation) along with the [Polaris' Layout component]. On the Layout component page, click `EDIT IN SANDBOX` to quickly start prototyping.

2. Visit the `polaris-react` repo and create a pull request for an issue that interests you. If it's your first time contributing note there's are a [bunch of issues tagged "Good first issue"](https://github.com/shopify/polaris-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22).

3. Interested in building an embedded app using Polaris? Checkout our new guide [Build a Shopify app using Node and React](https://developers.shopify.com/tutorials/build-a-shopify-app-with-node-and-react). If you start right away, may be able to the end the fourth section [Build your user interface with Polaris](Build your user interface with Polaris). There are also [starter files](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-demo-app-node-react/tree/build-your-user-interface-with-polaris-starter-files) if you want to skip the previous sections and start building your Polaris user interface right away.
